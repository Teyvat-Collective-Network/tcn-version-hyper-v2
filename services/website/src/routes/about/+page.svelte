    <h1>About the TCN</h1>
    <p>
        The Teyvat Collective Network is a group of high-quality Genshin Impact Discord servers dedicated to fostering communities dedicated to characters. We
        offer help and resources to each other and other servers to create a more healthy and welcoming environment for Genshin Impact fans across Discord.
    </p>
    <h2>Organization</h2>
    <p>
        We aim to improve servers through offering connections and resources, and we believe that diversity among and across communities is important. As such,
        we do not enforce a particular structure nor do we offer any server template or common format.
    </p>
    <p>
        Servers are not expected to change anything about their setup; our only requirements are to support each other by displaying the TCN partner list,
        following the network-wide event promotion channel, and maintain a safe community that follows its rules.
    </p>
    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <p>Our primary benefit is information and collaboration. We offer connections to a large number of established servers, which gives you many benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information on members and ongoing issues.</li>
        <li>On-demand technical and community and staff management help.</li>
        <li>Informative resources on things like server setup and tools.</li>
        <li>Global channels, allowing your community to talk with other communities and your staff to connect with other staff.</li>
        <li>
            <a href="/info/banshares">Banshares</a>, which let you receive information on and optionally automatically ban problematic users before they cause
            you trouble.
        </li>
        <li>Strong relationships to establish yourself and collaborate with many servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Transparency</b> &mdash; We prioritize two-way communication with our member servers. We are always open to feedback and will reach out for opportunities
            to improve the network to work for our members, and not the other way around.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Democracy</b> &mdash; In addition to communicating major changes with our members clearly, we propose these changes and vote on major decisions on
            them, and the observer team does not have any more of a say in matters than everyone else. Each server gets one vote in all important matters. We also
            implement follow-up changes based on feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Collaboration</b> &mdash; We don't expect everyone in the TCN to like everyone else, but even when discussions are heated we treat each other with
            civility and get to the core of the issue and come to a resolution that can benefit us all as much as possible. Additionally, we learn from conflicts,
            and every mistake or dispute is an opportunity to not just fix the root of the issue but improve other parts of the network.
        </li>
    </ul>
